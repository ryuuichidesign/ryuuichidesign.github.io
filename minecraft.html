  <h1>Minecraft Sculpture</h1>
  <p>I decided to do a pixel art-style structure of Link, the main protagonist of the Legend of Zelda series of video games. Gaming culture has been a recurring element of my life and I feel that the very first Zelda game on the original Nintendo Family Computer was an integral piece of history that has shaped how games are being designed today. It's one of the first games that presented its game world as a single large immersive sandbox to explore rather than a collection of isolated environments separated as levels. On top of that, the top-down view of the classic Zelda games gave an alternative perspective to video games which were heavy on the sidescrolling perspective at the time. I have never 3D printed anything before, but I'm aware of what it is and what comes out of it, so rather than going for a pure pixel art direction, I decided to make something that I could potentially display in a room after painting in the right colors, for example, something with a far amount of volume and able to stand up sturdily.There's actually two sides to my sculpture, looming behind Link is his shadow counterpart, Dark Link, which was one of the hardest bosses I had to deal with as a kid because he was designed to mimic and counter the player's every move. I added Navi, a "tagalong helper" type of fairy character that appeared in a later installment, Ocarina of Time, which was one of the first and most prolific 3D games to have been released. I connected her to the Link sculpture using glass blocks. The character of Navi for me also represents the idea of hand-holding in modern video games, where instead of the player getting acquainted  with the rules and workings of the game world on their own, hints or overly long tutorials are given. At the same time, the idea of a tagalong character accompanying you on a dangerous adventure is a comfy concept, especially in games meant for single player immersion.
I used sand for Link's skin because there is no dyed wool block that I know of that is close to a light skin color. Shadow Link's palette was hard to work with, he's essentially a palette swap of Link, but I had less colors to work with for him: White, Black, Gray and Light Gray. This won't matter when it's 3D printed because it'll all come out one color and I'll end up painting it anyway, but I did build this with the additional intent of how it would appear in the Minecraft game as well and I did not want to be half-hearted about it knowing that.</p>
