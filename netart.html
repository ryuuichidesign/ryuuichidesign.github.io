  <h1>Net Art</h1>
  <p>I did a website in a choose-your-own adventure style. There has been a recent issues over the last couple of years when it comes to video game development and design, where customers outside the target demographic of a video game will often complain that games are too hard and that every video game should have an easy mode. This entitlement often becomes bad enough that such people will harass game designers on social media, for example, the man responsible for games like Starcraft insists that it's his freedom to design his games however he pleases without adding a difficulty setting that takes away from the core vision of his product and he got verbally attacked for it on Twitter. I think entitlement is becoming an issue for today's youth not just when it comes to specific hobbies like video games, but in general. A similar issue is happening on social media when artists post their artworks, for instance. There are plenty of options available for everyone, but instead of looking into those options, they demand that absolutely everything should cater to them in an almost juvenile fashion.

I make use of iframes, sound and custom fonts on my net art, as well as embedded video.</p>
