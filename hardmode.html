<h1>Welcome to Hard Mode</h1>
<p>You started the game in Hard Mode, which in actuality, is the only mode the game was designed with. You equip your sword and shield and head out into the open, only to get brutally destroyed by common enemies like a scrub.</p>

<p>This game might be too hard for you. You have a few choices.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="titlescreen.html" target="frame">Start the game again and try to get accustomed.</a>
<br><a href="newskillget.html" target="frame">Buy another game that is designed to be assessible.</a>
<br><a href="youtube.html" target="frame">Complain and demand that the developer be forced to include easier difficulties in every game they make..</a></p>
